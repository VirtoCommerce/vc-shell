# VirtoShell: VirtoCommerce Vue3 Frontend for specialized back-office applications

The project is originated to create a replacement of the current vc-platform manager concept.

## Main project goals

- Technological shift from AngularJS to Vue3 for platform backoffice UI development.
- Split core components into separate packages with own release cycle.
- Simplify and speed up customization of any existing or brand new specialized (use case oriented) Backoffice applications with the help of unique VC design system. It's a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build a number of applications.

## Tech stack

- **lerna** (managing monorepo and its packages dependencies).
- **Vue 3** as background for our solution.
- **webpack** based on `vue-cli-service` for easy build and deployment.
- **storybook** for interactive documentation.
