# Quick Implementation Plan

Spend MAX 3 minutes exploring (no more than 5 file reads), then output:

## Plan Format
- **Goal**: One sentence
- **Approach**: 2-3 bullet points
- **Files to change**: List with one-line descriptions
- **Existing components to reuse**: Check CLAUDE.md "Reusable Components" section
- **What could break**: List affected behavior

Then ask: "Approve this plan? Any changes?"

After approval, implement immediately. Do NOT create PLAN.md, PROGRESS.md, CONTEXT.md, DECISIONS.md, or REVIEW.md files.
